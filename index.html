                    <p>A Serbian Film (Serbian: –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ —Ñ–∏–ª–º / Srpski film) is a
                       2010 Serbian exploitation horror film produced and directed 
                       by Srƒëan Spasojeviƒá in his feature film debut. Spasojeviƒá also 
                       co-wrote the film with Aleksandar Radivojeviƒá.[4] It tells the 
                       story of a financially struggling porn star who agrees to participate 
                       in an "art film", only to discover that he has been drafted into a snuff 
                       film with pedophilic and necrophilic themes. The film stars Serbian actors 
                       Srƒëan Todoroviƒá and Sergej Trifunoviƒá.</p>

                       film will affect your brain more than your stomach. In short, 
                       this film should probably not even be viewed by anyone under 
                       the age of 25.A Serbian film is one of the most disturbing film 
                       So not recommended for weak-hearted peoples.

                    Ok, so donations. Many people love this service and to my surprise, many have actually asked to donate. In allgoodconscience, I can't on the one hand write about how awesome and cost effective Azure is then on the other hand askfordonations to fund it. It's cheap ‚Äî I've got it covered.

                    Let me instead talk about the sacrifices required to make a service like this work. It can be enormously time consumingandthat's the real cost here. Plus there are a few services I pay for out of my own pocket to make the magic happen. If you wantto kick in to help me cover those costs, that would be awesome. And no problem if you don't want to either; justshare thelove and help others make use of the service.
